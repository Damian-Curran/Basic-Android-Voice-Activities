## Using the app

You can use the app in one of two ways.

Firstly, you can open the app by touch and tap the mic button which allows the app to capture what you say, it will then print what it heard out onto the screen.

Secondly, you can launch the app by using 'Ok, Google' and then saying the phrase 'Search for [query] on [appName]'

The '[appName]' in this instance is 'microphone'. It won't do anything after launch, in the backened you can see that it captured the query.

This is the extent of which this app has been developed, further development may continue...
